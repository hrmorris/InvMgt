IMPORTANT CONTEXT: This is a SUPPLIER INVOICE (Accounts Payable) - an invoice FROM a supplier TO a company. Extract the SUPPLIER information (the entity billing/sending the invoice), NOT the buyer/recipient company.

**CRITICAL: SUPPLIER NAME EXTRACTION IS THE #1 PRIORITY**
You MUST identify the supplier/vendor company name. Look EVERYWHERE on the document:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    SUPPLIER IDENTIFICATION - EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

LOOK FOR SUPPLIER NAME IN THESE LOCATIONS (in order of priority):

1. **COMPANY STAMPS/SEALS** - CRITICAL!
   - Look for circular, rectangular, or oval RUBBER STAMPS anywhere on the document
   - Stamps often contain: Company name, Registration number, Address, Phone
   - Stamps may be in corners, near signatures, or at bottom of page
   - Read ALL text within stamp boundaries including faded/partial text
   - Common stamp text: ""RECEIVED"", ""PAID"", company logo with name

2. **LETTERHEAD/HEADER** (Top of document)
   - Company name in large/bold text at very top
   - Logo with company name beside or below it
   - Business name in decorative/stylized font

3. **BILL FROM / FROM / SELLER / VENDOR Section**
   - Look for labels: ""From:"", ""Bill From:"", ""Seller:"", ""Vendor:"", ""Supplier:""
   - Company name immediately after these labels

4. **BANK ACCOUNT DETAILS**
   - Account holder name in payment/banking section
   - ""Pay to:"", ""Payee:"", ""Account Name:"" fields

5. **TAX/REGISTRATION INFORMATION**
   - Company name near TIN, ABN, GST, VAT numbers
   - ""Registered Name:"", ""Business Name:"", ""Trading As:""

6. **FOOTER/BOTTOM OF PAGE**
   - Company name in footer text
   - ""Thank you for your business - [Company Name]""

7. **WATERMARKS**
   - Faint company name watermarked across document

8. **SIGNATURES**
   - Printed name near signature lines
   - ""Authorized by [Company Name]""

9. **CONTACT INFORMATION BLOCKS**
   - Company name above address/phone/email blocks

NEVER RETURN ""Unknown"" FOR SUPPLIER NAME - Keep searching until you find it!
If multiple company names appear, the SUPPLIER is the one:
- At the TOP of the document (letterhead)
- Associated with bank/payment details
- On stamps/seals
- NOT in the ""Bill To"" or ""Ship To"" section

**CRITICAL: SCAN ALL PAGES OF THIS DOCUMENT**
- This document may have MULTIPLE PAGES
- You MUST read and analyze EVERY page of this PDF
- Extract information from ALL pages, not just the first page
- Line items may span multiple pages
- Totals are often on the LAST page
- If there are MULTIPLE SEPARATE INVOICES in this document, extract the FIRST invoice and include a warning noting how many other invoices were found

ADVANCED SCANNING PROTOCOL:

1. MULTI-PAGE DOCUMENT ANALYSIS:
   - Scan ALL pages from beginning to end
   - Track page continuations (e.g., 'Page 1 of 3')
   - Identify continued line items across pages
   - Look for summary/total on the last page
   - Combine data from all related pages

2. DOCUMENT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
   - Identify document layout, headers, footers, and sections
   - Detect tables, columns, and data relationships
   - Recognize logos, watermarks, STAMPS, SEALS, and signatures
   - Read both printed text and handwritten annotations
   - Process multi-column layouts and complex formatting
   - **CAREFULLY EXAMINE ALL STAMPS AND SEALS FOR COMPANY NAMES**

3. INTELLIGENT DATA EXTRACTION:
   - Extract SUPPLIER/VENDOR information (the company sending the invoice, usually at the top)
   - Distinguish between 'Bill From' (supplier) and 'Bill To' (buyer/recipient)
   - Use contextual understanding to identify invoice elements
   - Cross-reference multiple data points for accuracy
   - Detect and handle multiple date formats automatically
   - Identify currency symbols and decimal separators
   - Extract data from tables with merged cells or irregular layouts

4. QUALITY ASSURANCE:
   - Verify mathematical accuracy of all calculations
   - Cross-check totals against line item sums
   - Validate date logic (invoice date should be before or equal to due date)
   - Identify missing or ambiguous information
   - Flag inconsistencies or potential errors

COMPREHENSIVE EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    INVOICE NUMBER EXTRACTION - CRITICAL RULES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**INVOICE NUMBER IDENTIFICATION - APPLY STRICT REASONING:**

The invoice number is a UNIQUE IDENTIFIER assigned to this specific document. It is NOT the document type/title.

✅ VALID INVOICE NUMBERS - These ARE invoice numbers:
   - Numeric: ""36"", ""1234"", ""00123""
   - Alphanumeric: ""INV-2025-001"", ""A12345"", ""YS-36""
   - With prefixes: ""INV001"", ""PO-123"", ""REF/2025/001""
   - With dates: ""INV20250131"", ""2025-001""
   - Sequential codes: ""#36"", ""No. 123"", ""Inv No: 456""

❌ NOT INVOICE NUMBERS - These are document TYPE labels, NEVER use as invoice number:
   - ""TAX INVOICE"" (document type, not a number)
   - ""TAX INVOICE/STATEMENT"" (document type, not a number)
   - ""INVOICE"" (just a label)
   - ""STATEMENT"" (document type)
   - ""CREDIT NOTE"" (document type)
   - ""DELIVERY NOTE"" (document type)
   - ""PROFORMA INVOICE"" (document type)
   - ""COMMERCIAL INVOICE"" (document type)
   - ""RECEIPT"" (document type)

🔍 WHERE TO FIND THE ACTUAL INVOICE NUMBER:
   1. Look for fields labeled: ""Invoice No"", ""Invoice #"", ""Inv No"", ""Invoice Number"", ""Bill No"", ""Reference No"", ""Doc No""
   2. Usually appears AFTER the document title ""TAX INVOICE"" heading
   3. Often in a box, table cell, or highlighted area
   4. Near the top-right or in a header section
   5. May be handwritten if printed form
   6. Look for a NUMBER or CODE - not descriptive text

🧠 REASONING PROCESS FOR INVOICE NUMBER:
   1. First, identify the document TYPE (e.g., ""TAX INVOICE"") - DO NOT use this as invoice number
   2. Then, search for a SPECIFIC field labeled ""Invoice No"", ""Inv #"", ""Reference"", etc.
   3. The invoice number should be SHORT and UNIQUE (typically 1-20 characters)
   4. If you see ""TAX INVOICE"" followed by ""No: 36"" → The invoice number is ""36"", NOT ""TAX INVOICE""
   5. If document shows ""Invoice No.: 36"" anywhere → Extract ""36""
   6. Always extract ONLY the number/code portion, not the label

⚠️ SPECIAL CASES:
   - If field shows ""Invoice: TAX INVOICE/STATEMENT"" → SEARCH ELSEWHERE for actual number
   - If no invoice number found after exhaustive search → Use filename reference (e.g., extract ""36"" from ""InvNo_36.jpeg"")
   - Never return descriptive text like ""TAX INVOICE/STATEMENT"" as the invoice number

- Dates: Parse ANY date format and convert to YYYY-MM-DD (handle DD/MM/YYYY, MM-DD-YY, written dates, etc.)
- SUPPLIER Information (Bill From): Extract SUPPLIER/VENDOR details including:
  * Supplier name - MANDATORY! Check stamps, letterhead, bank details, everywhere!
  * Supplier address (full address)
  * Supplier email
  * Supplier phone
  * Tax ID/VAT number
- Line Items: Extract ALL items from ALL PAGES including hidden details, notes, SKU/part numbers
- Pricing: Capture unit prices, quantities, discounts, taxes, subtotals
- Payment Terms: Extract payment methods, bank details, payment instructions
- Additional Notes: Capture terms, conditions, special instructions, delivery notes

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this EXACT structure (no markdown, no extra text):
{
  ""invoiceNumber"": ""string (required) - MUST be the actual invoice number/code, NEVER a document type like TAX INVOICE"",
  ""invoiceNumberSource"": ""string - where you found the invoice number (e.g., 'Invoice No field', 'header', 'filename')"",
  ""invoiceDate"": ""YYYY-MM-DD (required)"",
  ""dueDate"": ""YYYY-MM-DD (required)"",
  ""customerName"": ""SUPPLIER/VENDOR company name (required - the entity billing you)"",
  ""customerAddress"": ""SUPPLIER/VENDOR full address or null"",
  ""customerEmail"": ""SUPPLIER/VENDOR email or null"",
  ""customerPhone"": ""SUPPLIER/VENDOR phone or null"",
  ""totalAmount"": 0.00,
  ""notes"": ""string or null"",
  ""items"": [
    {
      ""description"": ""string (detailed description)"",
      ""quantity"": 1,
      ""unitPrice"": 0.00
    }
  ],
  ""pagesScanned"": 1,
  ""multipleInvoicesDetected"": false,
  ""totalInvoicesInDocument"": 1,
  ""confidence"": ""high"",
  ""warnings"": null
}

VALIDATION RULES:
- All required fields must have values
- **INVOICE NUMBER VALIDATION**: The invoiceNumber field MUST NOT contain document type labels:
  * REJECT if invoiceNumber equals or contains: ""TAX INVOICE"", ""STATEMENT"", ""CREDIT NOTE"", ""PROFORMA"", ""RECEIPT"", ""DELIVERY NOTE""
  * If you extracted a document type label, SEARCH AGAIN for the actual invoice number
  * The invoice number should typically be numeric or a short alphanumeric code
- Dates must be valid and logical (invoice date should come before or equal to due date)
- All amounts must be positive numbers
- Quantity must be at least 1
- Total should match sum of (quantity times unitPrice) for all items
- If total does not match, note it in warnings
- customerName should contain the SUPPLIER name (who is billing), not the buyer
- If multiple invoices are detected, set multipleInvoicesDetected to true and include a warning

Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.";

                    PNG BANK STATEMENT ANALYSIS PROTOCOL
                    (BSP, Westpac PNG, ANZ PNG, Kina Bank)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔍 PHASE 1: DOCUMENT RECOGNITION
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Identify document type:
• BSP INTERNAL PAY NOW - Internal transfer within BSP bank
• BSP DOMESTIC PAYMENT - Transfer to other PNG banks
• WESTPAC PNG TRANSFER - Westpac bank transfer
• ANZ PNG PAYMENT - ANZ bank payment
• KINA BANK TRANSFER - Kina Bank transfer
• GENERAL BANK STATEMENT - Other bank documents

Look for bank logos and headers:
• BSP (Bank South Pacific) - Green logo
• Westpac PNG - Red 'W' logo
• ANZ PNG - Blue logo
• Kina Bank - Orange/Yellow logo

🔍 PHASE 2: BSP INTERNAL PAY NOW SPECIFIC FIELDS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

HEADER INFORMATION:
• Company Name (appears at top, e.g., ""APCM BALIMO HOSPITAL"") - This is the PAYER/OUR COMPANY
• Transaction Date/Time (top right, e.g., ""02 Oct 2025 03:55:50 PM"")

FIELD EXTRACTION (Read these EXACT labels):

1. REFERENCE NUMBER:
   - Transaction identifier (e.g., ""2527501057343002"")
   - This uniquely identifies the bank transaction

2. TRANSFER TO:
   - Supplier name WITH bank suffix (e.g., ""Roselaw Limited BSP"")
   - The ""BSP"" at the end means supplier banks with BSP
   - Other suffixes: ""Westpac"", ""ANZ"", ""Kina""

3. ACCOUNT TYPE:
   - ""Internal"" = BSP to BSP transfer (same bank)
   - ""Domestic"" = BSP to other PNG bank (different bank)

4. ACCOUNT NUMBER:
   - Full supplier account (e.g., ""3447021471979"")
   - PARSE AS: First 3 digits = Branch Number (e.g., ""344"")
   - PARSE AS: Remaining digits = Account Number (e.g., ""7021471979"")

5. ACCOUNT NAME:
   - Supplier/Payee name WITHOUT bank suffix (e.g., ""Roselaw Limited"")
   - This is the clean supplier name for matching

6. TRANSFER FROM:
   - Our company's bank account (e.g., ""9501000585602"")
   - PARSE AS: First 3 digits = Our Branch (e.g., ""950"")
   - PARSE AS: Remaining digits = Our Account (e.g., ""1000585602"")

7. AMOUNT:
   - Payment amount with currency (e.g., ""PGK 13,508.88"")
   - Extract numeric value: 13508.88
   - Currency is typically PGK (Papua New Guinea Kina)

8. TRANSFER WHEN:
   - Payment date in format ""DD Mon YYYY"" (e.g., ""02 Oct 2025"")
   - Convert to YYYY-MM-DD format for output

9. PURPOSE:
   - Payment reason (often empty)
   - May contain invoice reference or description

10. NOTE:
    - Comments/reference field
    - Often contains invoice number (e.g., ""InvNo1956_VehicleFreight_RoselawLtd"")
    - Extract invoice number if present

🔍 PHASE 3: INTELLIGENT PARSING
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

BANK NAME EXTRACTION from Transfer To:
• If ends with "" BSP"" → Bank = ""BSP"" (Bank South Pacific)
• If ends with "" Westpac"" → Bank = ""Westpac""
• If ends with "" ANZ"" → Bank = ""ANZ""
• If ends with "" Kina"" → Bank = ""Kina Bank""

ACCOUNT NUMBER PARSING:
For PNG bank accounts, the format is typically:
• 3-digit branch code + 10-digit account number = 13 digits total
• Example: 3447021471979 → Branch: 344, Account: 7021471979

INVOICE REFERENCE EXTRACTION from Note field:
• Look for patterns: ""InvNo"", ""INV"", ""Invoice"", ""Inv #""
• Example: ""InvNo1956_VehicleFreight_RoselawLtd"" → Invoice: ""1956""
